# overview
Welcome to the ultimate password recovery challenge! Your mission, if you choose to accept it, is to recover the password from an unseen location. We provided an npz file containing a list of tokens and their corresponding embeds. However, there's a problem - the password is hidden in a low-dimensional manifold within a vast, high-dimensional space.

# Purpose
Your goal is to extract the password. Passwords are in the form of FLAG{something}, and the key to success lies in navigating complex, high-dimensional spaces to find hidden information.

# data
Although we strongly believe that data knowledge is not required to solve this problem, we provide such information nonetheless.
The file contains two keys:
- tokens: Contains a list of tokens that are part of the password.
- embeddings: Contains the corresponding embeddings of each token in the same order.
